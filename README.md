The purpose of this repository is to get a feel of git and GitHub to be later able to maneuver it on our own.
The steps that were taken to complete this activity started with a quick brush up on the instructions and then downloading the software. 
Ran into some difficulties understanding the platform of git, so a youtube video was watched in order to learn how to make a branch and other aspects of github
Collaborators are: Tyrese Brutus, Angela Simons
